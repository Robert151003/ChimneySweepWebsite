        Regular chimney sweeping is essential for a safe and efficient fire. 
        Without proper ventilation through the chimney, fires can leak deadly 
        carbon monoxide into your home, putting lives at serious risk. Not only 
        that, but clogged and dirty chimneys are liable to catch fire. Over time 
        creosote—a highly flammable substance—builds up in your chimney. A 
        chimney fire can spread to your roof and home, so it is best to avoid. 
        You should aim to have your chimney swept and inspected once a year,  
        usually in spring or summer. Give us a call today to arrange a fast, 
        friendly, and efficient chimney sweep or service!
